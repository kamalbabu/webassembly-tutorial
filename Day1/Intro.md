What is webassembly?

New capability
High performance code in browser
Not a replacement for Javascript but it works along with Javascript
Code runs expremely fast . Near native speed.


It's a binary format specifically safer than Javascript. It has a whole security layer by design.
It is portable. Runs in whole lot of browsers. All the modern browsers.

Code size is reduced. So it is transfered faster.


How it works?

We can use cpp or rust to compile code to wasm module and load the same with javascript.


Why do you need it?

Application needs to be more performant. i.e Need for near native speed.


You have legacy native code and you need to bring the same to web.
